        on your system. All of the features in TypingMaster Pro and the Satellite 
        are also explained. Please read this manual carefully before installing 
        TypingMaster Pro on your computer. This will ensure a trouble free installation 
        and an easy startup. You will also know how to take advantage of all the 
        features TypingMaster Pro has to offer.</p>
      <h1><a name="2"></a>2. Installation</h1>
      <p>TypingMaster Pro is available both on CD and in electronic form. </p>
      <p>If you purchase the program with electronic delivery, you will not receive 
        a CD with your purchase. Instead, after your purchase a key will be sent 
        that will unlock the demonstration version of TypingMaster making it a 
        fully functional product with all the lessons enabled.</p>
      <p>Therefore, in order to install TypingMaster Pro you will need a connection 
        to the Internet to download the demonstration version of TypingMaster 
        Pro (or at least know someone who has a connection) and an email address 
        where the license information will be sent. </p>
      <p>This section will explain the necessary steps to download TypingMaster 
        Pro and get it installed on your computer.</p>
      <p>If you have purchased the program on a CD, you can skip the Downloading 
        portion of the instructions. The rest of the installation instructions 
        apply to both forms of delivery.</p>
      <h2><a name="21"></a>2.1 Downloading</h2>
      <p>Please download the latest version of TypingMaster Pro from this address: 
        <a href="http://www.typingmaster.com/goto/offline.asp?go=/gettmPro.asp" target="_blank">http://www.TypingMaster.com/gettmPro.asp</a>. 
        Click on this address to start downloading. </p>
      <p>If this download link does not work, you can go to the TypingMaster Pro 
        download page, which is located at: <a href="http://www.TypingMaster.com/goto/offline.asp?go=/individuals/pro/demo.asp" target="_blank">http://www.TypingMaster.com/individuals/pro/demo.asp</a>. 
        In this page you will find the download link for TypingMaster Pro.</p>
      <p>If you get a popup window asking you whether you wish to save the program 
        to disk or run it from the current location, select saving and click on 
        'OK'. This will allow you to select a location on your hard 
        disk where the setup package will be saved.</p>
      <p>We recommend saving the setup package to your Desktop, this way you will 
        be able to start the installation program directly from your Desktop.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="usr2_01.gif" width="300" height="186"></p>
      <p>When you select 'Save' the download will begin. The size of 
        the installation package is around 3.6 MB. If you are using a modem, please 
        reserve adequate time for the download process. The estimated download 
        time with a 56K modem is around 10 minutes.</p>
      <em> 
      <p><strong>TIP:</strong>  If you are experiencing trouble with downloading 
        or download speeds are considerably lower than your connection to the 
        Internet, please cancel the download and click on the download link again.</p>
      <p>Clicking on the download link will direct your browser to retrieve the 
        installation from one of three servers. This is used to even out the server 
        load. At times a server may be busy and downloading from another server 
        will be quicker.</p>
      <p>Also try downloading during off peak hours, this will ensure that the 
        servers are not under a heavy load during your download.</p>
      </em> 
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2><a name="22"></a>2.2 Logging In</h2>
      <p>The installer will first ask you a few questions on where you wish to 
        install TypingMaster Pro and the type of installation. After this, the 
        program will copy all necessary files to your installation folder and 
        create shortcuts to the Start -menu. In this section we will go through 
        the different choices you will have that affect the installation of TypingMaster 
        Pro.</p>
      <p>If you are installing the program into a network, for example at a school 
        or company, please refer to the <a href="http://www.typingmaster.com/goto/offline.asp?go=/support/pro/netguide.htm">Network 
        Installation Manual</a> for detailed installation information.</p>
      <p>Please exit all programs before starting the setup program. Other programs 
        running in the background may have an adverse effect on the installation. 
        Please print this section of the manual if you wish to see the instructions 
        when installing. If you do not want to print this section, read through 
        the instructions before installing. This will give you an idea of the 
        choices you will make during installation. The instructions are organized 
        into a list where a section represents a screen from the setup program</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ol>
        <li> 
          <p>The install program will start by asking you to close all running 
            programs. If you do not have any other programs running select 'Next' 
            to continue. Otherwise, select 'Cancel' and close all other 
            programs and restart the setup program.<br>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>You will be presented with the License Agreement. Please read through 
            this agreement carefully before accepting its terms. (It's always 
            a good idea to know what you are getting into :-) By selecting 'I accept the agreement' you indicate that you have read the agreement and accepted its terms 
            and the installation will continue. If you select 'I do not accept the agreement' the 
          setup program will abort. </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p> Now you can specify the folder where TypingMaster will be installed. 
            The default folder is C:\Program Files\TypingMaster\ If you are satisfied 
            with this folder select 'Next'. If you are unsure of where 
            to install TypingMaster select 'Next' since the default 
            folder works best with most computer setups. </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>Now you will be asked which type of setup you wish to install on 
            your computer. The choices you make here affect what components will 
            be installed to your computer. The following table will describe each 
            of the setup options and the components that will be installed with 
            each option. Please select the option that is the most appropriate 
            for you and click on 'Next'.<br>

      <h1><a name="3"></a>3 Starting TypingMaster Pro</h1>
      <h2><a name="31"></a>3.1 Launching</h2>
      <p>When you installed TypingMaster Pro to your computer, the installation 
        program added TypingMaster Pro to your Start menu and to your Desktop.</p>
      <p>To start the program just either double click on the TypingMaster icon 
        on your Desktop or click on the Start -button and go to Programs. Here 
        you will find the TypingMaster folder which contains the program and manuals. 
        Please click on 'TypingMaster Pro' to start the program.</p>
      <h2><a name="32"></a>3.2 First time launching</h2>
      <p>The first time you start TypingMaster Pro you will be taken to the New 
        User screen to create a user.</p>
      <p>Since many people can be using TypingMaster on one computer or computer 
        network, TypingMaster Pro has user names to distinguish between users. 
        All your user information will be stored under this user name. When you 
        start TypingMaster Pro with your user name, you can continue practicing 
        from where you left off before.</p>
      <h2><a name="33"></a>3.3 Logging in</h2>
      <p>Once you have created your first user for TypingMaster Pro each time 
        you start the program you will be taken to the login screen.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="usr2_03.gif" width="500" height="366"></p>
      <p>The login screen consists of a 'User name' field where you 
        will enter your user name. If there are many users from the same computer, you can also select your user name from the 
        drop-down menu by clicking on the arrow at the end of this field. (This 
        option can be disabled by a network administrator for security reasons).</p>
      <p>If you are using TypingMaster Pro on a network and the administrator 
        has opted to use password protection, a 'Password' field is 
        also shown.</p>
      <p>After entering or selecting your user name you can start the program 
        by selecting 'Enter'. </p>
      <p>If you want to make a new user account please select the option 'I 
        am a new user...' This will bring up a screen where you can enter 
        your user name and enter the program.</p>
      <p>If you enter a new name to the 'User name' field and select 
        'Enter', the program will ask whether you are a new user. If 
        you answer 'Yes' the program will start with the user name you 
        typed in.</p>
      <p><strong><em>TIP:</em></strong><em> TypingMaster Pro supports special 
        characters in user names. This means that you can use special characters 
        (such as dash and period) in your user name and the program will recognize 
        them correctly.</em></p>
      <p><em> However, in general it's a good idea to give your user name in 'Firstname 
        Lastname' format (or if you are working with a large user base 'Lastname 
        Firstname' format).</em></p>
      <h2><a name="34"></a>3.4 Exiting</h2>
      <p>You can exit TypingMaster Pro at any time by clicking on the 'Close' 
        button located in top right corner of the program screen. Also the standard 
        X button in the window frame can be used to exit the program.</p>
      <p>When you exit TypingMaster Pro your current settings and studying information 
        is saved, so that when you start the program again, you can continue from 
        where you previously left off. Please note that only completed exercises 
        are saved. If you are in the middle of an exercise when exiting, the specific 
        exercise information is not saved.</p>
      <h1><a name="4"></a>4. Using TypingMaster</h1>
      <p>This section of the manual will go through your first use of the program, 
        explain the user interface and guide you in studying touch typing with

      you were up to. </p>
      <p>From here you can start to learn with the exercises for that lesson. Simply click on the exercise in the list to begin. We strongly recommend 
        starting from the top and working down through the list as this is how 
        the course was designed to be taken. The program will automatically advance 
        from one exercise to the next and from one lesson to the next. However 
        you are free to any exercise or to move forward or backwards between lessons. 
        To advance lessons click on the &gt;&gt; button to go to the next lesson.</p>

      <p class="cnt_note" style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>NOTE:</strong> The courses can be studied in 
        any order you like. The Course Selection page though is designed to work 
        you through the optimal learning order. We highly recommend taking the 
        courses in the order they are listed in the program.</p>
      <h3><a name="422"></a>4.2.2 Lessons</h3>
      <p>Each course consists of lessons which are in turn made up of exercises, 5-8 in each lesson depending on your setup. 
      </p>
      <p>When you begin a course, you will be presented with a screen of the first 
        lesson. In the lesson screen, you will see the title of the lesson and 
        all the exercises of the lesson listed. Information on the status of an 
        exercise is displayed next to each exercise. If an exercise is completed, 
        a check mark will be displayed. A blank circle indicates an exercise that 
        has not been completed.</p>
      <p>At the top of the screen the course name and the number of the current 
        lesson is displayed. This section also contains a 'Change course' 
        link which will take you to the Courses screen.</p>
      <p>To begin the lesson or continue to the next exercise, click on the exercise 
        you wish to take. The highlighted one is the next exercise in order you 
        should take. When the exercise is completed, you will return to the lesson 
        view.</p>
      <p>It is also possible to navigate between the exercises. If you wish to 
        study a specific exercise, select this exercise and click on 'Begin'. 
        To navigate between lessons, click on the lesson buttons at the bottom left and right, or click on the lesson number under the course name.</p>
      <h3><a name="423"></a>4.2.3 Exercises</h3>
      <p>The exercises are made up of five  exercise types. These basic exercise 
        types are explained in this section. </p>
<p>In addition to these  types, in teacher led courses, 
          the lessons can also include games played with the keys being studied. 
          The Review Wizard can also be used as  to train the keys that 
          have shown to be difficult for you. </p>
<p>After completing the exercise, TypingMaster will display information on the Duration, Gross Speed, Accuracy and Net Speed of your typing along with written evaluations and a comment.</p>
<p>Your Gross Speed is the actual speed at which you typed. The Net Speed is the Gross Speed minus the errors you made, also called adjusted typing speed. </p>
<p>        <b>Key drill</b></p>
<p>The keyboard exercises are designed to teach new keys. The screen in 
        a keyboard exercise is made up of a keyboard with the keys that are currently 
        being studied highlighted. </p>
<p>At the top of the screen, the sequence of keys to be pressed is shown. During the exercise, the key to be pressed 
      is colored green after a 2 second delay.</p>
<p>Underneath the keyboard, two hands are shown. A green dot indicates the 
        finger you should use to press the key in question. This helps you to 
        memorize the locations of the keys and also to use all your fingers effectively 
        when typing.</p>
      <p>At the right side of the screen a graph indicates the 
        amount you have completed from the exercise and time left. </p>
      <p><b>        Word drill </b></p>
<p>After learning the new key positions, you will copy words that are made up of  the keys already learned. Depending on the language version you are using, the appearance of word exercises may vary somewhat. However, the basic idea is the same.</p>
<p>In word exercises, you copy words that are shown in the top half of the 
          screen. </p>
<p>Your position in the original text is shown by highlighting the current 
        word and removing all copied words.</p>
      <p>The right side of the screen contains information on the completion of 
        the exercise.</p>
<p><strong>Sentence drill </strong></p>
<p>Sentence drills are quite similar to word drills. The program shows one sentence per screen. If the sentence is longer, the program automatically wraps it on two lines. You need to press Enter at the end of the sentence for a new sentence to appear. </p>
<p>        <b>Paragraph drill </b></p>
      <p>The paragraph exercise is again quite similar to the sentence drill. In the 
        paragraph drill you copy a longer passage of text instead of sentences or separate 
        words.</p>
      <p>The main difference in the paragraph exercise compared with the two previous types is that the program no longer forces you to type right before moving forward. You can type on even if you make mistake and therefore need to track your typing yourself. </p>
<p>When you copy a word and press the Space bar, TypingMaster considers the word final and no corrections can be made to it. If you notice and error when typing a word, you can go back and correct it just as long as you don't press Space. Words with errors are marked red. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">If you skip over one word in the source text, TypingMaster does not display 
        an error although this is counted as one. This is to help you keep your 
        typing fluent. If you jump over more than one word, TypingMaster displays 
        the word typed as being incorrect and also shows your position in the 
        original text.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;"><br>
  <strong>Text drill</strong></p>
<p>Text drills are the most challenging and most similar to real typing. The program will show about 15 lines of text at a time that you will copy to the bottom half of the screen. You will no longer have the keyboard visuals to help you but really need to remember the key locations. This drill type is also used as a Lesson Exam in the teacher led courses.</p>
<p>When you copy a word and press the Space bar, TypingMaster considers the word final and no corrections can be made to it. If you notice and error when typing a word, you can go back and correct it just as long as you don't press Space. Words with errors are marked red. </p>
<p>If you skip over one word in the source text, TypingMaster does not display an error although this is counted as one. This is to help you keep your typing fluent. If you jump over more than one word, TypingMaster displays the word typed as being incorrect and also shows your position in the original text.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="margin-top: 0;"><a name="43"></a>4.3 Optimized Duration</h2>
      <p>Optimized Duration is a unique TypingMaster feature that lets you complete 
        exercises quicker if you are making fast progress. Similarly, it will 
        provide extra practice when you need it.</p>
      <h3><a name="431"></a>4.3.1 How it works</h3>
      <p>Optimized Duration works by TypingMaster monitoring your progress in 
        real time when you do the typing drills. If your typing is accurate and 
        fluent enough, the program suggests that you move on and lets you complete 
        the drill in a shorter time span. If it looks like some more training is 
        needed, TypingMaster lets you complete the drill from beginning to end.</p>
      <p>With Optimized Learning, your training is based entirely on your personal 
        learning needs. As a result, you are likely to save a lot of unnecessary 
        practice. Your overall skill level will also be better, as weaknesses 
        are addressed immediately with extra training.</p>
      <p>To determine your progress TypingMaster monitors two factors during the 
        drills -- accuracy and typing speed:</p>
      <p><strong>Monitoring Accuracy</strong><br>
        Since good accuracy is the foundation of proficient typing skills, all 
        drills have an accuracy goal. TypingMaster monitors whether you reach 
        the goal and gives you feedback after each drill.</p>
      <p><strong>Monitoring Typing Speed</strong><br>
        TypingMaster constantly monitors your typing speed as well. The better 
        your speed, the sooner you can move on -- as long as you also reach the 
        accuracy goal. However, with a typing speed below 15 Words per Minute, 
        you'll benefit from typing for the full duration of the exercise.</p>
      <h3><a name="432"></a>4.3.2 Turn Off Optimized Duration</h3>
      <p>In case you want to decide how long the drills should be rather than 
        letting TypingMaster guide you, you can always turn off the Optimized 
        Duration.</p>
      <p>To turn off Optimized Duration:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to the lesson screen where the exercises are listed</li>
        <li>Click 'Adjust course duration' button at the bottom of the screen</li>
        <li>Click 'Turn off Optimized Duration'</li>
	  </ol>
      <p></p>
      <p>We do, however, recommend Optimized Duration where ever possible as it 
        helps not only to save your time but also provide you with the training 
        level needed.</p>
      <p class="cnt_note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> When using TypingMaster Pro in 
        school or company environments the Optimized Duration may not be enabled.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 0;"><a name="51"></a>5.1 Review</h2>
      <p>The review section of the program shows you statistics on the keys that 
        are giving you trouble and allows you to fine-tune your skills. </p>
      <p>TypingMaster Pro incorporates an intelligent Review system that monitors 
        your typing in the program. Based on the data it collects, the Review 
        creates information on your problem areas.</p>
      <p>This information can be viewed in the review section of the program.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="usr2_06.gif" width="500" height="342"></p>
      <p>The bottom half of the screen shows the keys you are having trouble using a scale OK-Difficult-Problematic. The keys are arranged from the most difficult 
        to the easiest. The difficulty level is based on the amount of mistyped 
        keys and corrections that you have made in the lessons, games and typing 
        test, in text type exercises also delays relative to your typing speed and rhythm. </p>
      <p>If some keys enter the difficult or problematic areas and the program suggests that you 
        review your problem areas, it's a good idea to follow this advice.</p>
      <h3><a name="511"></a>5.1.1 Review Options</h3>

      <h2><a name="52"></a>5.2 Typing Test</h2>
      <p>TypingMaster Pro includes a typing test that you can use to test your 
        current speed at any time.</p>
      <h3><a name="521"></a>5.2.1 Typing Test Options</h3>
      <p align="center"><img src="usr2_07.gif" width="500" height="366"></p>
      <p>On the Typing Test screen, under section 1, is an extensive range of test 
        texts which have been included. Select any to take a test. Next, in section 2, select 
        the Duration, a typical typing test is at least 5 minutes 
        long. Lastly click on the' Start Test' button to begin.</p>
      <p>Once you have completed a test it will appear in the Complete Tests list. 
        This contains all tests and lesson exams you have taken (lesson exams are only used 
        when studying in a school or company environment with teacher led courses). Here select a test 
        and then an option to the right to view results or a certificate. Both 
        these can be printed out (unless printing is disabled by the network administrator).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Adding texts </strong></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;">In addition to the test texts already available, you can add your own 
        text files to be used as test texts. To do this, all you need to do is 
        select 'Add' from the top of the screen and when the file browser pops up 
        select a plain text file to be added. </p>
      <p>Please make sure that the file you select is in <strong>plain text</strong> (these files 
        usually have the ending .txt) Text files created in a word processor and 
        saved as documents usually contain information on the layout of the text 
        and cannot be used.</p>
      <p>You can also delete tests from the list. Just select the test you wish 
        to delete and click on the Delete button.</p>
      <p>Before starting the test you can also specify a duration for the test 
        or specify the duration to be free. When this option is selected the test 
        will continue until the test text is finished or Cancel is selected.</p>
      <p>The bottom half of the screen contains information on the tests you have 
        previously taken. You can also choose to view and print out a diploma 
        of a selected test. When you select the option 'View/print diploma' 
        a new window will appear with a diploma stating the user's name and test 
        results. This diploma can be printed out by clicking on Print.</p>
      <h3><a name="522"></a>5.2.2 The Test</h3>
      <p>In the typing test, you will copy the text you have selected. The program 
        will count your speed and errors. During the test you can make corrections 
        to the word you are currently typing but after the space bar is pressed, 
        the word is considered final and no corrections can be made.</p>
      <p>If you jump over a word during the test, TypingMaster will automatically 
        jump to the correct position. Although missing a word is considered to 
        be an error, no error is marked to the text you are writing. This will 
        help keep typing fluent. If you jump over more than one word, the program 
        will mark the typed word as incorrect and display the correct position 
        in the original text by underlining the correct word.</p>
      <p>After the test, you will receive results on the outcome of the test. 
        The results will be displayed in WPM (Words Per Minute) or KPM (Keystrokes 
        Per Minute) depending on your selections in Settings. The duration of 
        the test will be displayed along with information on Gross speed, Accuracy 
        and Net speed.</p>
      <p>Gross speed is the speed at which you typed during the test. The accuracy 
        percentage counts the amount of words that were correct. With an accuracy 
        of 100% all words were typed correctly. Net speed shows your final speed 
        after errors and can also be called adjusted speed or adjusted words-per-minute.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="margin-top: 0;"><a name="6"></a>6. Games</h2>
      <p>TypingMaster Pro has three games that you can use to practice your typing 
        skills. They are also a good way to warm up before taking a typing test. 
        The games are listed below with brief descriptions.</p>
      <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="8" height="493">
        <tr valign="top"> 
          <td width="13%"><b>Bubbles</b></td>
          <td width="87%"> 
            <p>In this game you have to pop the bubbles before they reach the 
              surface. To pop a bubble, press the character that's inside the 
              bubble. Each pop gives you points. If you press the wrong key, points 
              will be taken away.<br>
              <br>
              When you miss six bubbles, the game ends. The faster red and blue 
              bubbles give you more points than the ordinary green ones. </p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr valign="top"> 
          <td width="13%"> <b>Clouds</b></td>
          <td width="87%"> 
            <p>In clouds, you will see a blue sky with clouds rolling by. Some 
              of the clouds will turn sunny and a word will appear under them. 
              On the other hand some clouds will turn dark and stormy. You can 
              catch both types of clouds by typing the word under the cloud.</p>
            <p>Try not to miss the stormy clouds, since after six missed stormy 
              clouds, the game will end. On the other hand, the sunny clouds will 
              give you lots of bonus points.</p>
            <p>You can move between the clouds at any time by pressing the Enter key to 
              go forward and the Backspace key to go back. You can also use the space bar to go 
              forward, but it will not work when a word is incomplete. </p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr valign="top"> 
          <td width="13%"><b>Wordtris</b></td>
          <td width="87%">This game is a variation of the classic Tetris. Instead 
            of trying to fit beams of different types to form rows, you have to 
            type the words in a beam and catch it by pressing the Space bar before it 
            hits the bottom.<br>
            <br>
            When the box fills up of uncaught beams, the game ends. To get the 
            best possible score, look at the word display at the bottom of the 
            screen when you are typing.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr valign="top"> 
          <td width="13%"><b>Abc</b></td>
          <td width="87%"> 
            <p>This simple game is a test in typing speed. The goal is to type 
              to letters from 'a' to 'z' as fast as possible. Typing each letter 
              gives you a score the faster you type them the better the score. 
              When you type a letter the bubble it is in will disappear and you 
              can then type the next letter. The game ends when all the letters 
              have been typed.<br>
              <br>
              As well as the letters 'a' through to 'z' you can select from other 
              combinations including capital letters and numbers.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;">Each of the games can be practiced using the keys that you have already 
        studied. The bubbles game can also be studied with small or capital letters 
        or both, or if that's too easy for you, you can always try numbers 0-9 
        with both small and capital letters. </p>
      <p>Clouds and Wordtris can also be played with a vocabulary of animals, 
        cars or proper names. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
      <h2 style="margin-top: 0;"><a name="7"></a>7. Statistics</h2>
      <p>TypingMaster Pro gathers detailed information on your typing all throughout 
        your studies. This information is then gathered into helpful statistics 
        which you can view in the Statistics section of the program.</p>
      <p>This chapter will describe the different statistics that TypingMaster 
        creates. We will also give you a few tips on how these can benefit you.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="usr2_08.gif" width="480" height="338"></p>
      <p>The first page under the Typing Speed tab shows the development of your 
        gross and net speed during the selected course. Each bar represents a 
        exercise and with the net speed or gross speed listed in the horizontal 
        axis.</p>
      <p>The second page under Accuracy tab shows the development of your accuracy 
        percentage. It is very important that you aim for a hundred percent, since 
        your overall performance will suffer considerably if you make many mistakes, 
        no matter how good your typing speed is. The second page of statistics 
        also shows the keys you are having difficulty in. These keys can be trained 
        in the Review section of the program.</p>
      <p>Naturally, it would be preferable if the general direction of the graphs 
        were upward. However, since new keys are being constantly learned, getting 
        used to them will naturally take a while. If the graphs show a considerable 
        slump in one lesson, it might be a good idea to revisit this lesson and 
        make sure that you master the keys taught in that particular lesson.</p>
      <p>It is also possible to view and print out a Progress Report on all of 
        the lessons and typing tests taken. Just click on the Progress Report 
        button at the bottom of either Statistics page. A user report sheet containing 
        detailed information on all exercises from all lessons and courses as 
        well as typing tests will be displayed.</p>
      <p class="cnt_note"><span class="cnt_bld">NOTE:</span> Statistics are shown independently for each course. To chance courses 
        select the course you wish to view the statistics for from the top drop 
        down menu.</p>
      <h2><a name="8"></a>8. Settings</h2>
      <p>The Settings for TypingMaster can be reached by selecting 'Settings' 
        from the 'Menu'. The settings enable you to select your keyboard 
        layout and modify some aspects of the program.</p>
      <p>You can change the following options in the settings screen:</p>

          <td width="84%">This option allows you to select the method of counting 
            typing speed. If WPM is selected your speed will be counted in Words 
            per Minute. With KPM selected Keystrokes per Minute will be used for 
            counting. </td>
        </tr>

              part, 'Full Screen' is a zoomed view that increases the center program 
            part (recommended for  visually impaired users).

      <h1><a name="9"></a>9. Satellite</h1>
      <p>This section of the manual will give you a detailed tour of TypingMaster 
        Satellite. First, we will give you an introduction to this tool and explain 
        the general concept of it. Next we will explain how to set it up to your 
        own computer and finally we will show how you can make the most out of 
        this program.</p>
      <h2><a name="91"></a>9.1 Introduction</h2>
      <p>A special interactive tool called TypingMaster Satellite is incorporated 
        into TypingMaster Pro.  TypingMaster Satellite tracks your everyday 
        typing in any windows program (e.g. when you type a letter in Word or 
        an email in Outlook Express). Based on the information the program gathers 
        about your typing, it will create custom exercises that will train your 
        weaknesses. Since  TypingMaster Satellite creates exercises to train 
        the keys you are currently having trouble with, the Satellite will be 
        able to help you develop and fine-tune your typing very effectively.</p>
      <p>How it works:</p>
      <ol style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        <li>Typing Analysis<br>
          <br>
          Selecting Satellite from the Program menu takes you through the steps 
          need to launch the Satellite. The Satellite then starts to monitor your 
          typing in any Windows program. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Customized Training <br>
          <br>
          Based on the information that the Satellite has gathered on your typing, 
          TypingMaster Pro will create material tailored to you needs. The personalized 
          exercises can be found on the Satellite menu once you have launched 
          the Satellite.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Quick Results<br>
          <br>
          With these precisely focused exercises, you can get significant results with just 
          a couple of hours of practice.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Continuing improvement<br>
          <br>
          Since the Satellite constantly monitors your typing, TypingMaster Pro 
          can always create fresh material to meet your changing needs.<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="cnt_note" style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>NOTE:</strong> The TypingMaster Satellite is 
        language and keyboard independent! </p>
      <p class="cnt_note">Since the program monitors only your actions on the 
        keyboard (for example the fluency of your typing, the number of errors 
        and corrections you make), you can write in any language of your choice 
        and the program will still detect your problems areas.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="margin-top: 0;"><a name="92"></a>9.2 Setting up the Satellite</h2>
      <p>This section will explain how to start monitoring your typing.</p>
      <p>First, start TypingMaster Pro. After logging in, please select Satellite 
        from the Menu, alternatively the Satellite is listed as the second course 
        to take in the Choose Course screen, this will take you to the same place. 
        Selecting the Satellite for the first time will take you to an introduction 
        screen. Here you are given general information about the Satellite and 
        some key settings for the program:</p>
      <p><strong>Automatic Launch</strong><br>
        The Satellite can be configured so that it is started automatically when 
        you start up Windows. It is recommend that you choose this option as this 
        is the best way to monitor your typing during normal computer usage.</p>
      <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10">
        <tr valign="top"> 
          <td width="26%"><b>Launch Satellite automatically</b></td>
          <td width="74%"> The Satellite will launch when you start Windows with

        me when training is needed' option checked.</p>
      <p><strong>New to TypingMaster Pro is the Take a Break feature</strong>. This is designed 
        to help keep your computing experience a good one by encouraging you to 
        take regular breaks to strech and move around. This helps with ergonomics trying to prevent repetitive 
        strain from using a computer too much. To enable this simply leave the 
        Take a Break option checked and select how often you would like to be 
        reminded.</p>
      <p><strong>Security<br>
        </strong>Security options give you the possibility to use the Satellite 
        in High Security mode. In this mode the program does not collect any difficult 
        words, it only records keys that are giving you trouble. In addition to 
        this, the Satellite monitors only the programs that are specifically selected. 
        This mode is recommended if you are working with many programs that require 
        passwords or deal with sensitive material.</p>
      <p>To enable this check the 'Do not collect words' option.</p>
      <p><strong>Launch<br>
        </strong>Once you have made your selections click on the 'Launch' 
        button to start the Satellite. After one more screen you are then taken 
        to the Satellite Training screen When you return to the Satellite section 
        after launch you will be taken directly to the Training screen.</p>
      <p class="cnt_note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Although the Satellite has a 
        High Security setting, the program itself does not fulfill high security 
        requirements. However, it is possible to obtain high security with the 
        appropriate Windows NT settings.</p>
      <p class="cnt_note">Even though the Satellite can be set up in a way that 
        will not compromise security, <strong>TypingMaster does not under any 
        circumstances guarantee the security of the TypingMaster Satellite.</strong></p>
      <p class="cnt_note">Therefore the program cannot be recommended in environments 
        where security is of utmost importance (e.g. military or development facilities). 
        Please read the information on TypingMaster Satellite and security and

      <h2 style="margin-top: 0;"><a name="93"></a>9.3 TypingMaster Satellite</h2>
      <p> TypingMaster Satellite is a small program that monitors your typing 
        while you are using Windows.</p>
      <p>When the Satellite has been set up, you will notice it as a TypingMaster 
        icon in the task bar at the lower right on your screen. When the Satellite 
        is collecting information, the icon lights up. When it is disabled, you 
        will see a cross on top of the key.</p>
      <p>To take advantage of the Satellite click on the icon to reveal the Satellite 
        menu. </p>
      <h2><a name="94"></a>9.4 Satellite Menu</h2>
      <p>By clicking on the icon in the task baryou can invoke the Satellite menu.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../Satellite menu.gif"></p>
      <p>Most of the settings can also be modified from TypingMaster Pro under 
        the Satellite heading. However, this menu offers a quicker and easier 
        way to modify and access the Satellite settings and learning material.</p>
      <p>The first option from the top takes you to the Satellite training in 
        TypingMaster Pro. Use this when you want to train with your problematic 
        keys and words. The second option will take you to the Satellite Statistics 
        in TypingMaster Pro, this is a quick way to view your progress with the 
        Satellite. Below that takes you to the Satellite settings, see below for 
        more information.</p>
      <p>The middle option displays the application that is currently being monitored. 
        If you do not want this application to be monitored, just click on this 
        option and the application will not be monitored again.</p>
      <p>When you select 'Show Info on Top', a small Satellite Info 
        window will appear. This window will display real 
        time information on your typing speed, typed words and the amount of time 
        you have been typing.</p>
      <p>Use the 'Enabled' option to stop and start the Satellite. When you select 
        the last item in the menu 'Close' a dialogue box will pop up 
        asking you whether you want to close the Satellite. This dialogue also 
        contains a check box for launching the Satellite automatically at Windows 
        logon. If this box is not selected, the Satellite will not automatically start 
        when Windows is started.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="margin-top: 0;"><a name="95"></a>9.5 Satellite Settings</h2>
      <p>The Satellite settings can be reached from the Satellite menu or from TypingMaster 
        Pro by selecting Satellite from the menu and clicking on Satellite settings.</p>
      <p>You can control every aspect of the Satellite from the Satellite settings. 
        Below the different the different settings tabs are listed along with 
        explanations and tips.</p>
      <p><strong>Personal tab</strong></p>
      <p>The personal tab displays all personal settings for Satellite. The current 
        user is displayed after the heading.</p>

          <td width="79%">
            <p>You can choose whether you want the Satellite to remind you to 
              take breaks. Each reminder also includes some useful ergonomics tips with practical things you can do to ease the strain of computer 
              usage.</p>
            <p>To use the feature check the check box and then with the slider 
              set how often the Satellite should remind you. Do note that the 
              Satellite detects when you are not using the computer, so the slider 
              indicates time of active use with the keyboard and mouse.</p>

            recommend training after a certain amount of information has been 
            gathered. To enable this, check the check box. You can select the 
            interval of recommending from the slider.</td>

          <td width="79%"> 
            <p>The first check box stops programs from being monitored by the 
              Satellite automatically. This means that when a new program is opened, 
              by default, the Satellite will not monitor your progress. If you 
              wish the Satellite to monitor the program when this is checked simply 
              click on the icon to bring up Satellite menu and click on the middle 
              row with the program name. This will place a check next to it to 
              let you know it is being monitored.</p>
            <p>The second check box can be used for high security as it does not 
              collect your difficult words. When this is selected, Satellite will 
              only gather information on difficult keys. This reduces the risk 
              of delicate information, such as passwords, being saved and used 
              in the training exercises.</p>

      <p>The radio buttons at the bottom of your screen let you change between 
        viewing all applications that the Satellite has detected and applications 
        that are currently running.</p>
      <p>The top window will then display these applications. If an application 
        is selected for monitoring, a check will appear next to it. Please uncheck 
        all applications containing confidential information. When you select 
        an application from the list, you can see its complete path below the 
        application list.</p>

            <p>It is recommended that this option be turned on to ensure that 
              Satellite gathers information every time you use Windows. The more

              using the computer. </p>
            <p>If you have Windows set up so that either you are the only person 
              using it or each user has their own profile, the first option is 
              recommended. In these cases the Satellite knows automatically which 
              person is using the computer. Please select your user name from 
              the drop-down list. Now the Satellite will automatically gather information 
              under this name when you log on to Windows.</p>
            <p>However, if you have many people using the same computer and do 
              not have profiles set up, it is recommended that you select 'Show 
              user list at startup'. When this is selected, the Satellite 
              will ask the user to select their user name from the list each time 
              the computer is started. This will eliminate the possibility of 
              the Satellite recording information under a wrong user name.</p>
            <p>If you do not want for the Satellite to ask you your user name 
              each time you log on, please select the option 'Start in logged 
              off mode'. This will start the Satellite with no user selected 
              and it will not gather information until a user logs in (click on 
              the icon to select the user).</p>

      <h2><a name="96"></a>9.6 Training</h2>
      <p>This section of the Satellite will help you fine-tune your typing in 
        the problem areas that the Satellite has detected. The training section 
        can be reached from the the Satellite menu in TypingMaster Pro or directly 
        from the Satellite menu.</p>
      <p>To start training select a duration for the training session from from 
        the drop-down menu labeled section 1. If you select 'No time limits' the lessons will be gone through without any time limitation. Then click 
      on the 'Start Training' button.</p>
      <p>Once you start training you will be presented with a list of exercises 
        and the difficulty index. You can work through the exercises in any order 
        but it is recommend you take them from top to bottom. The difficulty index 
        of the letters and words you have is displayed at the bottom and will 
        be updated after each exercise.</p>
      <p>Click the OK button to exit the exercise screen.</p>
      <p>You can fine-tune your typing with the TypingMaster Satellite continually. 
        Any time you feel the need for some brushing up, just select 'Training...' 
        from the Satellite menu and new material will be created to address your 
        current needs.</p>
      <h2><a name="97"></a>9.7 Analysis</h2>
      <p>Under the Analysis tab which you can select from the top of the Satellite 
        page in TypingMaster Pro, information on your difficult keys, capitals 
        and words is shown. The keys and capitals are ordered according to their 
        difficulty. If you have some problematic keys or capitals, it's a good 
        idea to start the customized practice to get you familiar with these keys.</p>
      <p>The list of difficult words is also ordered according to a word's difficulty. This list of words can also be edited by selecting a word 
        or group of words from the list and selecting 'hide' to hide 
        your selection or 'edit' to edit the last selected word. Words 
        can also be added to this list by selecting 'add' and writing 
        the word or words separated by a comma to the box and selecting OK. When 
        a word is added manually, it will get a difficulty percentage of 100.</p>
      <h2><a name="98"></a>9.8 Statistics</h2>
      <p>This section of the Satellite can be reached in two ways, either by selecting 
        'Statistics...' from the Satellite menu or by selecting the 
        'Statistics' tab at the top of the Satellite section in TypingMaster 
        Pro.</p>
      <p>The Satellite Statistics give you a detailed analysis of the typing you 
        have done in Windows. The statistics are divided into four sections and 
        give information on your typing speed, how much you typed, how many words 
        you typed and you problem index.</p>
      <p>The indices are based on the information that Satellite gathers on the 
        fluency of your typing, errors being made and words you are having difficulty 
        mastering. If your overall difficulty index is high, it might be a good 
        idea to start the customized practice in order to iron out the problems 
        you are having.</p>
      <p>You can set for what time period you wish to view information from the 
        top drop-down menu, the options are: Last 7 days, Last month and Last 
        year.</p>
